# Application Description
The Pawfect Match App is a full-stack web application that connects pet lovers with pets available for adoption. Users can create an account, login, search for pets available for adoption in their area, add pets to their account, and view a list of all the pets they have added. Users can also view the profiles of other pet owners and see the pets they have added to their account. Additionally, users can comment on the pets added by other users and delete their own pets and comments.
