As a pet owner or pet lover, I want to be able to create an account, login, and search for pets available for adoption in my area. I also want to be able to add pets to my account and view a list of all the pets I have added. Additionally, I want to be able to view the profile of other pet owners and see the pets they have added to their account. Finally, I want to be able to comment on the pets added by other users and delete my own pets and comments.
